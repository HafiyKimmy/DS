# Discrete Structure 
This course introduces the basic concepts of discrete structures used in computer science. Students learn topics such as set theory, relations, functions, counting, graphs, trees, and finite automata. By the end of the course, students will be able to use these concepts to analyze and solve computer science and real-world problems.
